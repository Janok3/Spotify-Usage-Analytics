# Spotify-Usage-Analytics
## Description
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science Course Fall 2024-2025 Term Project.

This project will be an analysis of my Spotify usage depending on the amount of school work I have.

## Motivation
While think about what do analyze for my project the music streaming service Spotify came to mind. This is because it is the only app that I use to listen to music and I almost exclusively listen to music to pass the time on my way to school. I do not stay in the dorms and going to my university takes me almost 2 hours one way. So, if I am busy with school work I often choose to not go to school to study on my own time as it gives me at least an extra 4 hours to do what I need. This lead me to the hypothesis that if I look at my Spotify usage, I can determine the periods of time where I was extra busy with school work. 

## The Plan
I plan on taking data from Spotify via their API and looking at how much music I listen to on any given day. Then I can compare this data with the data that I got from my task list on Notion to see if my hypothesis is true. If I listended to less music on a given day, that will most likely mean I did not go to school to focus on an assignment or exam. 

## Data Source
I will have two different sources of data:
1. Data exported from Spotify.
2. Data taken from my task list on the Notion app.

There are APIs for both Spotify and Notion so that will most likely be how I export my data but I might just be able to copy the data from Notion by hand.

In addition to the data from my task list, I might choose to use the academic calender for my university for a more general understanding.

## Getting the Data
### Spotify
I first tried to use the spotify API to get my listening history but quickly realised that I could only access the last 50 songs I listened to. This would not be enough as I wanted an entire years worth of listening data. 

After doing some more research, I figured out that I could download my data from Spotify's website which would give me all the data I needed so that is what I did.

The listening history was located in the "StreamingHistory_music_0.json" file so I took that file and wrote a python script to read and parse that data.

### Notion 
Notion also allows users to download their data so that is what I did.

I took the cvs file that had my task list data, used a cvs to json converter online to convert the data into json format since I find that easier to work with.

## Parsing the data
### Spotify Listening History:
I needed 2 things from my Spotify listening history:
1. The date of when I played a song
2. How long I listened to the song 

The date was already in the format that I wanted to I didn't change it.

The time was in miliseconds so I converted it to hours to make it easier to understand.

### Notion Task List:
I needed 2 things from the Notion task list:
1. Name of the task
2. When the task is due

The name is not strictly necessary, but I still wanted to if I decided to do more detailed analysis.

The date needed some work as it wasn't as consistent as I needed it to be.

Here are some examples of the different date formats:
* March 22, 2024
* January 3, 2024 2:57 PM
* March 11, 2024 23:59 (GMT+3)
* May 11, 2024 15:00 (GMT+3) â†’ 16:30

I converted the dates into the same format as Spotify to keep things consistent.

## Resulting Graphs
### Task Amount vs Time Spent Listening to Music by Day:

### Task Amount vs Time Spent Listening to Music by Week:

## Findings:
There are a few things we need to keep in mind while examining the data to better understand it and draw a conclusion on whether or not my original hypothesis was correct.
* The graph spans a year with one semester spanning from 15.02.2024 to 09.06.2024, summer break in between and the other semester spanning from 23.09.2024 to 10.01.2025 (The dataset only goes to 26.12.2024)
* The midterm exams start at around 6-7 weeks into the semester.

### Observations:
On the graph we can see that the amount of tasks are in an upword trend as the semester progresses. Meanwhile, the amount of time spent listening to music is on a downword trend during the same time. 
During the beginning of the semesters is when I listened to the most amount of music, this is because I did not feel the need to skip any classes to focus on schoolwork. However, as the semester progresses and the amount of work from exams, more difficult homeworks and term project increase; I start to listen to less music since I don't going to school the same amount and also I use the time during my commute to read up on the course material rather than listen to music to better prepeare for my exams. 
All of these observations give confidence to my original hypthesis being true. However, it is important to keep in mind that there are some limitations of this analysis.

## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations:
The biggest limitation in this project was the dataset. For the quesiton I am trying to answer, a larger dataset consisting of a wider variaty of data would help strengthen the confidence in the answer to the hypothesis even further. For instance, if I could access the payment history of my student card; I would be able to see when I used the shuttle service provided by my university.
### Future Work:
Using more complex data analysis methods and/or machine learning algorithms, along with the previously mentioned bigger dataset, could help us draw stronger conclusions from this analysis.
